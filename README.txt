A small (use at you own risk, as always) mod for myself and other people playing Hypixel Skyblock
Contains:

A customizable Keybind to snap your yaw to the nearest 15° to help with aligning (for e.g. 90° or 45°)


A customizable Toggle-Button to set your sensitivity to zero and 
swap the keys you wanted to swap (e.g. jump to Left Click and attack to space)

A command (/farmingkeys) to choose the keys that get swapped.
/farmingkeys <set|get|reset> <action> <key_name>

You can also swap the keys by enabling the mode and changing the keybinds in the vanilla minecraft controls menu.
Support for all implemented actions and valid buttons
