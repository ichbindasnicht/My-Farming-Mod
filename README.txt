A small (use at you own risk, as always) mod for myself and other people playing Hypixel Skyblock
Contains:
A customizable Toggle-Button to set your sensitivity to zero and 
swap the keys you wanted to swap (e.g. jump to Left Click and attack to space)

A command (/farmingkeys) to choose the keys that get swapped.

A customizable Keybind to snap your yaw to the nearest 15° to help with aligning (for e.g. 90° or 45°)

/farmingkeys set jump|attack MOUSE0|SPACE

for now only keys for jumping and attacking/breaking implemented. If it proves neccessary or wished for, i will add more keys and/or more actions you can bind
